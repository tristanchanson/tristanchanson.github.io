title:  "Project: Petshop"
---

Welcome, I am Tristan Hanson and I have been a software engineer in the financial industry for the past 7 years. Over those years I have been asked many questions about everything from story writing and code structure to code design patterns and deployment architectures. 

I am hoping to bring together all of those questions and answer then through the development and deployment of a pet shop management application. Along the way we will dive into each piece of the planning and development process to explain each part in detail. 

Keep a look out for upcoming posts as we begin this project.
